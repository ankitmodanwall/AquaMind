The user has provided the following answer:
- Question: "{{{question}}}"
- Their Answer: "{{{answer}}}"
- Correct Answer: "{{{correctAnswer}}}"

Reference Educational Content:
"{{{educationalContent}}}"

Player's Knowledge Level: {{{playerKnowledgeLevel}}}

**Instructions for Generating Feedback:**

1.  **Determine Correctness**: Compare the user's answer to the correct answer.

2.  **Generate Feedback (If Incorrect):**
    *   Start with a gentle and encouraging tone. Acknowledge their effort (e.g., "That's a good thought...").
    *   Clearly state that the answer is incorrect without being discouraging.
    *   Provide the correct answer and a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation of why it is correct. Use the provided "Reference Educational Content" as the primary source for your explanation.
    *   Elaborate on the core concepts. Explain the 'why' behind the answer. For example, if the topic is groundwater sources, explain what groundwater is, where it comes from (recharge), and why it's a vital resource.
    *   Connect the concept to real-world impact and conservation. Provide actionable tips (e.g., "Simple actions like fixing leaky faucets...").
    *   End with a positive and motivational closing statement that encourages them to continue learning.

3.  **Generate Feedback (If Correct):**
    *   Start with enthusiastic praise (e.g., "Excellent!", "That's exactly right!").
    *   Confirm their answer is correct and briefly reiterate why.
    *   Use the opportunity to deepen their knowledge. Provide an interesting, supplementary fact or a more advanced concept from the "Reference Educational Content".
    *   Reinforce the importance of the topic and encourage them to apply their knowledge.
    *   End with a positive and forward-looking statement.

4.  **Final Output**: The entire feedback should be a single, cohesive, and well-written paragraph. Ensure the tone is supportive and educational throughout.
